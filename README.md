# BitChopp

Casa21's BitChopp is a simple GUI that allows us to sell draft beer.

## Using Just

For a better experience, we recommend using [Just](https://just.systems/) to run the project.

Download and install the latest version of Just from [github](https://github.com/casey/just/releases).

After installing Just, you can check the available options by typing:

```bash
just
```

### Running without Just

If you don't want to use Just, you can check all the available commands in the [justfile](justfile) and run them manually.
